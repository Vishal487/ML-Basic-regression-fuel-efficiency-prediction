# ML-Basic-regression-fuel-efficiency-prediction
This notebook uses the classic Auto MPG Dataset and builds a model to predict the fuel efficiency of late-1970s and early 1980s automobiles. To do this, we'll provide the model with a description of many automobiles from that time period. This description includes attributes like: cylinders, displacement, horsepower, and weight.

Data is taken directly from keras dataset.

The model we used is keras sequential model which contains only dense layers. Note that a single dense layer is equivalent to a complex regression.
